# Servous

Welcome to Servous!

In this game you play as a server, who is very nervous and needs you to stabalize his hand so he won't drop any drinks!

## Info
We made this project as a game for the DAE Unwrap GameJam of 2023. </br>
The theme was "Fragile". </br>
More info on this Jam can be found here: https://itch.io/jam/unwrap-jam-2023

## Controls
Move the mouse to control the hand. </br>
You can press "spacebar" to stop/resume the PlayerMovement, yet this will only waste time.

## Download
You can download this game on our itch.io page here: https://bramvernimmen.itch.io/servous </br>

All of us are Programmers, so we just divided the work on the go.
